The zip file contains the folder UCI HAR Dataset  whick contains 5 *.txt files ad 2 folders.

The two folders are train and test whcih contain the data for this project.  The data in each is merged into a single file
that is then manipulated to provide the tidy_data.txt output file.

The original large data set is extracted using the terms mean and std (standard deviation) fromt the descriptions.

The code is commented the the beginning of blocks so a reader can follow what is occuring.
